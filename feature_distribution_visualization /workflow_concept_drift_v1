### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, plotting, machine learning, and drift detection.

2. **Download Stock Data**:
   - Download Apple stock data from Yahoo Finance for the specified date range.

3. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Extract the closing prices and scale them to a range between 0 and 1 using [`MinMaxScaler`]

4. **Create Dataset with Sliding Window**:
   - Define a function [`create_dataset`] to create datasets with a sliding window approach for time series prediction.

5. **Build and Train LSTM Model**:
   - Define a function [`build_and_train_lstm`] to build and train an LSTM model on the reference data.

6. **Split Data into Reference and Current Sets**:
   - Split the scaled data into reference (60%) and current (40%) datasets.

7. **Train LSTM Model on Reference Data**:
   - Train the LSTM model using the reference data.

8. **Predict on Both Reference and Current Data**:
   - Use the trained LSTM model to make predictions on both the reference and current datasets.
   - Inverse transform the predictions to the original scale.

9. **Compare Performance on Reference and Current Data**:
   - Define a function [`print_metrics`] to calculate and print performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ²) for both reference and current data.

10. **Concept Drift Detection Using ADWIN**:
    - Initialize an ADWIN detector.
    - Iterate through the current data predictions, update ADWIN with the prediction error, and check for drift.
    - Log the dates and predicted values where drift is detected.

11. **Plot ADWIN Drift Points**:
    - Plot the actual stock prices, predicted reference prices, and predicted current prices.
    - Highlight the drift points detected by ADWIN in red.

12. **Concept Drift Detection Using Evidently AI**:
    - Define a function [`evaluate_drift_evidently`] to evaluate drift using Evidently AI.
    - Create sliding windows for reference and current data.
    - Run Evidently AI drift detection and generate a drift report.
    - Create a boolean mask for drift detection and log the dates and predicted values where drift is detected.

13. **Plot Evidently AI Drift Points**:
    - Plot the actual stock prices, predicted reference prices, and predicted current prices.
    - Highlight the drift points detected by Evidently AI in purple.

14. **Final Comparison of ADWIN and Evidently AI Drift Results**:
    - Print the number of drift points detected by ADWIN and Evidently AI.
    - Print the dates and predicted values for the detected drift points.

### Summary:
- The code downloads stock data, preprocesses it, and splits it into reference and current datasets.
- An LSTM model is trained on the reference data and used to make predictions on both reference and current data.
- Concept drift is detected using both ADWIN and Evidently AI, and the drift points are plotted and compared.
