### Monitoring Changes Over Time: Page-Hinkley monitors a sequence of data points, checking whether the average of these points suddenly shifts.

*** Detecting "Unusual" Changes: It tracks the difference between each new data point and the long-term average. If the sum of these differences becomes significantly large (beyond a certain threshold), it assumes a change has occurred.***

***When Drift Is Detected: If the accumulated differences show a sudden jump (meaning the data is no longer following the same pattern), Page-Hinkley triggers an alert, indicating that a significant change or drift has occurred.***

***In short, it helps spot when data starts behaving differently from before by watching how far off new values are from the "normal" pattern.***
